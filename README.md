# Advent of Code 2023

I use Perl for all the solutions.

Most assume the input data is in a file called `input.txt` in the same
directory as the file.

### A note on scoring

I award myself one point per star, but only if I manage to solve it myself without help. 

## TODO

## Solution comments in reverse order

Running score: 4 / 4

### Day 2: Cube Conundrum

Not a very hard problem, but I overthought how to parse the input and store it in a datastructure, which caused me a lot of problems in the beginning.

Score: 2

### Day 1: Trebuchet?!

Well this was a tough one for day 1! I started out ok enough with splitting on a regex, but quickly was stymied by overlaps like twone and oneight. After searching through my input for these I added special cases which found the correct result.

I then peeked in the subreddit for the specific weird-ass syntax required for overlapping matches, and included that as a comment.
