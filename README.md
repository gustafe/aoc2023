### Day 1: Trebuchet?!

Well this was a tough one for day 1! I started out ok enough with splitting on a regex, but quickly was stymied by overlaps like twone and oneight. After searching through my input for these I added special cases which found the correct result.

I then peeked in the subreddit for the specific weird-ass syntax required for overlapping matches, and included that as a comment.
